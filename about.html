Hello Everyone. My name is Prabhjot Arora. I am a BCA student.
I am interested in web/app development. The technologies that I can work 
with are HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, REACTJS and NODEJS which are the
core technologies for website development. For app development, I can work with
Flutter which is the UI framework for app development developed by 
<span style="color:red">Google</span>. If you do have any opportunities, I am open to work.
